# EPRefresh based on Underscores
Built with the help of Morten Rand-Hendriksen's LinkedIn Learning and Lynda.com course WordPress: Building Themes From Scratch Using Underscores, EPRefresh is an accessible content-first theme built around beautiful fonts and large images designed and developed by Brady Lee for [Evangelical Presbyterian Church](http://epannapolis.org/).

## Notes

EPRefresh's code base started out as _s (http://underscores.me) as it was on Monday, March 6, 2017.
